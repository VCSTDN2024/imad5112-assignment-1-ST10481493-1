Project Overview 

 

## Project Overview 
 
The Feast Finder is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD subject. This app was created using Kotlin and Android Studio to help people who struggle like myself to decide what to eat. 
 
Users can enter a time of day (e.g., morning, afternoon, dinner), and the app suggests a suitable meal. The project meets the assignment requirements by building a functional mobile app and using GitHub for version control with GitHub Actions. 
  

Why: 

The Feast Finder app is a simple meal suggestion tool designed to help users decide what to eat based on the time of day. Built using Kotlin and Android Studio, the app allows users to input a time (e.g., morning, afternoon, or dinner), and it provides a suitable meal recommendation. 

 

App Purpose and Features 

 

## Purpose and Features 
 
### Purpose: 
The main goal of the Feast Finder app is to help users when they don't know what eat it helps them decide what to eat by suggesting meals based on the time of day. Users enter a time (e.g., morning, afternoon, or dinner), and the app provides a suitable meal recommendation. This ensures quick and easy meal decisions, especially for those who struggle with choosing what to eat like myself. 
 
### Key Features: 
-Meal suggestions: Users enter a time of day, and the app provides a recommended meal. 
 
-Error handling: Displays a warning if the input is empty or incorrect.

-Reset button: Allows users to reset the input field and suggestion display easily. 
 
These features aim to provide a simple way for users to decide what to eat based on the time of day, making meal choices easier and stress-free. 
  

Design Considerations 

 

## Design Considerations 
 
The design of the **Feast Finder** was based on the following key considerations: 
 
1. Easy navigation – The app features a simple and user-friendly design, making it easy for anyone to input a time of day and receive meal suggestions effortlessly. 
 
2. Device compatibility – Designed to work smoothly across different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on various Android devices. 
 
3. Minimalist design – Focuses on essential features without unnecessary complexity, keeping the interface clean and straightforward. 
 
4. Optimized performance – Ensures quick meal suggestions with minimal resource usage, providing a smooth and efficient experience. 
  

 

GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization 

 

## GitHub and GitHub Actions 
 
This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were pushed. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity. 
 
### GitHub Actions: 
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes: 
 
- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality. 
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution. 
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access. 
 
The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

Challenges and Learnings 

 

## Challenges and Learnings 
 
During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including: 
 
1. Handling user input validation 
 
Solution: I put in checks to ensure the input field is not empty and only accepts valid time-of-day entries. Used error messages to guide users when incorrect input is detected. 
 
2. Ensuring smooth app performance across different devices 
 
Solution: Tested the app on various screen sizes and optimized the UI layout to be responsive and adaptable using ConstraintLayout. 
  

Why: 

Reflecting on these challenges helped me develop strong problem-solving skills and a better understanding of Android development best practices. 

By tackling input validation issues, I learned the importance of user-friendly error handling to improve the overall experience. Optimizing the UI for different devices reinforced the need for responsive design and thorough testing. 

Future Enhancements 

 

## Future Enhancements 
 
While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including: 
 
1. Personalized meal suggestions – Allow users to select dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan) for more tailored recommendations. 
 
2. Voice input – Enable users to speak instead of typing the time of day for added convenience. 
 
These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
